# 🖥️ OS Matching Game  

An interactive **drag-and-drop game** built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap** to help pupils learn and test their understanding of **Operating Systems** and the devices they run on.  

---

## 📖 Story Behind the Project  
While preparing lesson notes for my pupils on **Operating Systems**, I wanted the class activity to be more engaging than a simple worksheet.  
So, I built this **mini web game** to make learning fun and interactive.  

Instead of memorizing, pupils can now **play and learn**, matching devices (phones, laptops, tablets, desktops, smartwatches) with the correct Operating Systems (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux).  

---

## 🎮 How to Play  
- Drag an **OS logo** and drop it onto the correct **device**.  
- ✅ Correct matches stick, add to the score, and show success animations.  
- ❌ Wrong matches bounce back with feedback.  
- A **30-second timer** keeps things exciting.  
- A **progress bar** shows your completion status.  
- At the end, a **congratulations modal** appears with:
  - 🏆 Best Score (all-time high score).  
  - 🎯 Last Score (previous attempt).  
- Hit **Reset** to reshuffle devices and logos for a new game.  

---

## 🛠️ Built With  
- **HTML5** – Structure of the game.  
- **CSS3** – Styling, animations, and effects.  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Drag-and-drop logic, scoring system, timer, and reset functionality.  
- **Bootstrap 5** – Responsive layout, progress bar, and modal for results.
